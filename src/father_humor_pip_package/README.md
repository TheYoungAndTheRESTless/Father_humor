# Father_Humor


**Initialize application:**
To take advantage of the `father-humor-pip-package` utilize the native `import` method:
- `from father_humor_pip_package import scraper.py`
  - This will give you access to the three functions:
    - `dad_jokes()`will give you a random dad joke
    - `star_wars()`will give you a random Star Wars joke
    - `programming()`will give you a random Software Developer joke
  - In addition to the above functions, you can also take advantage of `helper()` which is a tutorial of sorts to help ensure that you have the appropriate dependencies installed and is an easy way to select random jokes from one of the three previously mentioned categories.
