Why did the itsy-bitsy spider run up the water spout? He heard a tech company executive was there hiring web designers. 
Why didn't the new Apple software work? The developer took a byte out of it.
There was an engineer, manager and programmer driving down a steep mountain road. The brakes failed and the car careened down the road out of control. Half way down the driver managed to stop the car by running it against the embankment narrowing avoiding going over a cliff.  They all got out, shaken by their narrow escape from death, but otherwise unharmed. The manager said, "To fix this problem we need to organize a committee, have meetings, and through a process of continuous improvement, develop a solution."  The engineer said, "No that would take too long, and besides that method never worked before. I have my trusty pen knife here and will take apart the brake system, isolate the problem and correct it."  The programmer said, "I think you're both wrong! I think we should all push the car back up the hill and see if it happens again."
Old Programmers do not die... they decompile.
